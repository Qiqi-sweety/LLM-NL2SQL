The rest of the array is filled in using dynamic programming, where the length of the longest common subsequence between two characters is the maximum of the lengths of the longest common subsequences between the characters themselves and the lengths of the longest common subsequences between the characters plus one. Finally, the length of the longest common subsequence is returned.

Create a function that takes in two strings and returns the longest common subsequence of the two strings.  Here's one possible implementation:  ``` def longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):     # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences     # between each pair of characters in the two strings     lcs = [[0] * (len(str2) + 1) for _ in range(len(str1) + 1)]          # Fill in the first row and column of the array with the lengths of the     # subsequences of the empty string and the empty string, respectively     for i in range(len(str1) + 1):         lcs[i][0] = 0     for j in range(len(str2) + 1):         lcs[0][j] = 0          # Fill in the rest of the array using dynamic programming     for i in range(1, len(str1) + 1):         for j in range(1, len(str2) + 1):             if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:                 lcs[i][j] = lcs[i - 1][j - 1] + 1             else:                 lcs[i][j] = max(lcs[i - 1][j], lcs[i][j - 1])          # Return the length of the longest common subsequence     return lcs[-1][-1] ```  This function takes in two strings `str1` and `str2` and returns the length of the longest common subsequence between them.
